# 🔔 Simple Sound Player
**A lightweight Android utility designed to play custom alerts triggered by system automation.**

## 🌟 How It Works
This is a simple sound player that will start playing a sound as soon as the app launches. It includes buttons for closing the app and choosing a sound. By default, it plays a notification sound, or you can select a specific sound within the app.

## 🤖 Use Cases (Automation)
This app is designed to work as an "Action" in automation workflows (like **Xiaomi Automation**, **Tasker**, or **MacroDroid**).
